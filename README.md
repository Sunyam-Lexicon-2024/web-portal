# Suny-Am Lexicon 2024 Web Portal

## Description

A web portal that aggregates repository information from the Github organization [Sunyam-Lexicon-2024](https://github.com/sunyam-lexicon-2024)

## Technology

The web portal is a React based SPA, built using Vite, Typescript and the Octokit library (used for Github API requests). As no authorization is utilized, the rate limiting is mitigated by querying a local JSON data object incase a request is denied (updated sporadically).
